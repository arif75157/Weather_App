# Weather_App

This is a simple, user-friendly weather dashboard that shows real-time weather updates based on the city you enter. I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it pulls live data from the OpenWeather API to give you details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions with easy-to-understand icons.

Whatâ€™s cool about it:

-Real-Time Weather: Enter any city, and youâ€™ll get up-to-date weather information.

-Dynamic Updates: The weather details change automatically based on what the API sends back.

-Error Handling: If you type in an invalid city, itâ€™ll let you know with a helpful message.

-Responsive Design: Looks great on both desktop and mobile, so you can check the weather anywhere.

-Efficient API Calls: Fetches weather data smoothly without slowing down the app.
