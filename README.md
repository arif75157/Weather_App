# Weather_App

This is a simple, user-friendly weather dashboard that shows real-time weather updates based on the city you enter. I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it pulls live data from the OpenWeather API to give you details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions with easy-to-understand icons.

What’s cool about it:

Real-Time Weather: Enter any city, and you’ll get up-to-date weather information.
Dynamic Updates: The weather details change automatically based on what the API sends back.
Error Handling: If you type in an invalid city, it’ll let you know with a helpful message.
Responsive Design: Looks great on both desktop and mobile, so you can check the weather anywhere.
Efficient API Calls: Fetches weather data smoothly without slowing down the app.
